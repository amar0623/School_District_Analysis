# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
This data was analyzed for the chief data scientist of a city school district. We prepared all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about school performance trends and patterns. Our original analysis was refactored to account for some pontential academic dishonesty from 9th graders at Thomas High School.

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?
   * The average math score fell from 79.0% to 78.9%.
   * The average reading score stayed the same at 81.9%.
   * The percent passing math decreased from 75.0% to 74.8%.
   * The percent passing reading only fell .1%.
   * The overall passing percentage fell from 65.2% to 64.9%.

* How is the school summary affected?
   * Thomas High School's average scores were not greatly affected overall. 
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
   * Thomas High School remained the second top school overall.
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
   * Replacing the scores does not affect math and reading scores drastically due to the fact that each grade already had scores between 83 to 84%. This will keep the averages overall very close to our original analysis.
   * Scores by school spending, school size, and school type are unaffected as well. Everything rounds to the same number.
